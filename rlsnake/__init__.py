'''
Set of constants used to run the project.

Constants are divided into two parts:
- "rlsgame": settings related to Pygame and the game logic.
- "rlsmodel": settings related to the neural network model and the agent.
- "rlshelper": setting related to plot and model saving.

You may modify these values to tweak the project behavior,
but do so at your own risk.
